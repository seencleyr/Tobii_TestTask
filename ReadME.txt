Class which responsibility is to sequentially execute tasks:
https://github.com/seencleyr/Tobii_TestTask/blob/master/Tobii_TestTask.Core/TaskManager.cs

1. Why 3 projects?
- Tobii_TestTask.Core: if you wanna look only into code this project for you;
- Tobii_TestTask.UI:   if you wanna run and look at how it works. I've prepared simulation of different simultaneously working clients;
- Tobii_TestTask.Test: classical test project.

2. I added comments only for describing my ideas for a reviewer and haven't added any regular comment like <summary> for class/public method/property.
