1. Why 3 projects?
- Tobii_TestTask.Core: if you wanna look only into code this project for you. TaskManager contains all main logic;
- Tobii_TestTask.UI:   if you wanna run and look at how it works. I've prepared simulation of different simultaneously working clients;
- Tobii_TestTask.Test: classic test project.

2. I added comments only for describing my ideas for a reviewer and haven't added any regular comment like <summary> for class/public method/property.
